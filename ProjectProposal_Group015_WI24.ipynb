        "We believe that specific settings of our chosen variables for analyzing a LEGO set such as the presence of Minifigures, widespread availability in stores and online, increased versatility of sets, and existence of visual media for popular entertainment significantly drives its popularity upwards. Simultaneously, we suspect that other attributes like price variability, color variability, number of pieces, and prescribed ages do not have a meaningful impact on the popularity."
