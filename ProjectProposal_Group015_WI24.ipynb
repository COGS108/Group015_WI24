        "LEGO® Group was built brick by brick to become the powerhouse that it is today, reaching millions of consumers and accumulating billions in revenue each year. Increases in global market share and profit margins reflect their rise in popularity. In 2022, the LEGO Group experienced a whopping 12 percent growth in consumer sales which can be attributed to introduction of sets from themes such as LEGO® City, LEGO® Icons and LEGO® Technic™, as well as themes with intellectual property partners such as LEGO® *Star Wars*™ and LEGO® Harry Potter™. All these LEGO sets have one thing in common - the brick - which comes in different shapes, sizes, and colors.\n",
        "\n",
        "LEGO®s were not always synonymous with the versatile plastic pieces meant for play, exploration, art or more. Ole Kirk Kristiansen, a master carpenter from Billund, Denmark, began crafting wooden toys, and combined the Danish words “Leg Godt” for “play well” to form the renowned “LEGO®” in 1936. Ole also launched the LEGO® bricks predecessors, Automatic Binding Bricks, however it was Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, his son, that catapulted LEGO® Group to new heights in the 1950s by introducing LEGO® System in Play and re-designing the LEGO® brick. The next few decades witness an explosion in available LEGO® sets due to the introduction of new pieces, themes, and entertainment as well as construction of stores, factories and theme parks.\n",
