        "LEGO® Group was built brick by brick to become the powerhouse that it is today, reaching millions of consumers and accumulating billions in revenue each year. Increases in global market share and profit margins reflect their rise in popularity. In 2022, the LEGO Group experienced a whopping 12 percent growth in consumer sales which can be attributed to introduction of sets from themes such as LEGO® City, LEGO® Icons and LEGO® Technic™, as well as themes with intellectual property partners such as LEGO® *Star Wars*™ and LEGO® Harry Potter™. All these LEGO sets have one thing in common - the brick - which comes in different shapes, sizes, and colors.",
        "\n",
        "LEGO®s were not always synonymous with the versatile plastic pieces meant for play, exploration, art or more. Ole Kirk Kristiansen, a master carpenter from Billund, Denmark, began crafting wooden toys, and combined the Danish words “Leg Godt” for “play well” to form the renowned “LEGO®” in 1936. Ole also launched the LEGO® bricks predecessors, Automatic Binding Bricks, however it was Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, his son, that catapulted LEGO® Group to new heights in the 1950s by introducing LEGO® System in Play and re-designing the LEGO® brick. The next few decades witness an explosion in available LEGO® sets due to the introduction of new pieces, themes, and entertainment as well as construction of stores, factories and theme parks.",

        "We believe that specific settings of our chosen variables for analyzing a LEGO set such as the presence of Minifigures, widespread availability in stores and online, increased versatility of sets, and existence of visual media for popular entertainment significantly drives its popularity upwards. Simultaneously, we suspect that other attributes like price variability, color variability, number of pieces, and prescribed ages do not have a meaningful impact on the popularity."

        "    1. The ideal dataset should contain information on every variable that we want to explore as it pertains to each individual LEGO set. Each entry in the dataset will correspond to one set where the key is the official set number. Each observation will contain the theme, number of pieces, the target age range, the number, color, and types of pieces, the number of mini figures, the sales of the set, the price of the set, both in retail and the secondhand market, and the availability of each set on stores and online. The properties of each set, such as theme, list of pieces, and age range, are printed on the box and are easily available. The price and exact sales figures do not seem to be public information, so we need to rely on third party sources to find this information. Since Lego is very popular and has a strong community, we can find this data or approximations elsewhere. Data will be transferred from their original sources to Python data frames and reorganized for visualization.",

We also do not have access to detailed sales numbers or availability at big box retailers, so we have to rely on these sites for information about the sets' popularity and price history. We also do not know who this data is coming from, so we have very little demographic information, and data from customers who do not use these sites."

        "# Ethics & Privacy",
        "",
        "When collecting our data, we must recognize the bias in any datasets we use. One example of a form of bias that might be prevalent is sampling bias - generally, we would expect more enthusiasts or fans inputting data / filling out surveys rather than the average consumer, which might influence the results in a certain direction. Another example of bias that may appear is age bias: LEGOs are generally marketed towards children, but any data collected will most likely be from adults because it is unlikely that children will be filling out surveys or agreeing to data collection. This might be a problem because, as mentioned previously, LEGOs are primarily marketed towards children, so when we create a predictive model based on adult data it may not reflect the larger population that we are trying to predict sales for. Lastly, time bias may appear as well since older sets may have more data than newer sets.",
        "",
        "When reviewing our datasets, we should be aware that when using user data generated from 3rd party sites, we are subjected to their data privacy policies which may not be completely ethical. If not already anonymized, we should anonymize any customer names or personal information and our predictive model should use that anonymized data. In addition, because LEGOs are primarily marketed towards children, we need to ensure that children’s privacy is protected, otherwise a data leak may cause accidental harm, legal ramifications or be detrimental to LEGO’s reputation.",
        "",
        "In order to ethically handle the data, we must ensure that any datasets we use from 3rd party sites follow all privacy laws and policies. To handle biases, we can try to use as much inclusive data we can from our datasets. Despite our efforts, there may still be biases, so we must make sure that anybody using the model is aware that it may not necessarily reflect the larger population."
