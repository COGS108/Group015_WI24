    "LEGO® Group was built brick by brick to become the powerhouse that it is today, reaching millions of consumers and accumulating billions in revenue each year. Increases in global market share and profit margins reflect their rise in popularity. In 2022, the LEGO Group experienced a whopping 12 percent growth in consumer sales which can be attributed to introduction of sets from themes such as LEGO® City, LEGO® Icons and LEGO® Technic™, as well as themes with intellectual property partners such as LEGO® *Star Wars*™ and LEGO® Harry Potter™ <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). All these LEGO sets have one thing in common - the brick - which comes in different shapes, sizes, and colors.\n",
    "LEGO®s were not always synonymous with the versatile plastic pieces meant for play, exploration, art or more. Ole Kirk Kristiansen, a master carpenter from Billund, Denmark, began crafting wooden toys, and combined the Danish words “Leg Godt” for “play well” to form the renowned “LEGO®” in 1936 <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Ole also launched the LEGO® bricks predecessors, Automatic Binding Bricks, however it was Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, his son, that catapulted LEGO® Group to new heights in the 1950s by introducing LEGO® System in Play and re-designing the LEGO® brick <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The next few decades witness an explosion in available LEGO® sets due to the introduction of new pieces, themes, and entertainment as well as construction of stores, factories and theme parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 2016 analysis conducted by Mode data scientist Joel Carron, revealed some interesting findings from a 67-year timeline of LEGO® sets. For instance, LEGO® bricks are graying and large sets with more pieces continue to grow while small sets are relatively the same <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Thus, we find it critical to analyze the colors and number of pieces across all types of sets. Another notable trend is that the number of sets released each year have increased except when the LEGO® group was battling against bankruptcy between the years of 2004 and 2009 <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This is not surprising as the whole world was experiencing a financial crisis and many companies struggled to stay afloat. Hence, this period of financial uncertainty could have an impact on our data, and we need to be cognizant of the fact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, a 2021 analysis by data enthusiast Yvonne Zhang that was inspired by the previous study disclosed more updated findings. For example, 9,625 sets out of 16,691 unique sets have themes <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). Simply put, themed LEGO® sets make-up 58 percent of all sets and could indicate a greater influence than generic sets. Zhang also emphasized that majority of sets were derived from LEGO® System theme before 1970, then shifted to Legoland theme in the 1970s and onto other themes such as Duplo, Universal Building, Bionicle from the 1980s to the 2010s <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). This goes to show that themes can come and go, but the bricks are here forever. LEGO® Group needs to continue developing and releasing new themes to keep capture the heart of their fans and the wallets of their consumers. Zhang reaffirms the upward trend for number of sets and number of pieces per set <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). This further indicates that the two quantitative characteristics could have a significant impact on measuring the popularity of future sets. Lastly, Zhang elaborated on how the bricks are graying by showing that black, white, light bluish gray, dark bluish gray, and red are the dominant colors in the past 72 years <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). When color tastes changes in society, then color palettes on products do the same. As a result, color cannot be overlooked when attempting to predict the popularity of a future set. \n",
    "\n",
    "A recent 2023 analysis by data analyst Tyran Christian provided the most extensive and eye-opening look into LEGO sets by using a data set from Rebrickable. Star Wars and Technic sets have the highest number of parts and have longevity amongst other favorites including Duplo, City, Creator, Ninjago with Marvel Super Heros being a rising theme <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). Here we can see that older themes remain strong in the market, yet new themes are able to breach the rankings. Another relationship to unpack would be the popularity of classic LEGO themes in comparison to licensed themes. Christian demonstrated that classic themes like Western, Vikings or Adventurers increased in value after their end-of-life similar to licensed themes such as Batman, Spider-Man and Indiana Jones despite assumption that licensed themes would perform better <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). Christian even recommended two ways to further his analysis: implement a predictive machine learning model and add LEGO Minifigures data <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). We plan to take his recommendations into account and develop these pathways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This preliminary research helped us better understand the current trends and what has already been done. Our project aims to update these previous projects with 2024 data by performing similar analyses and to expand by analyzing other variables that have not been considered. For instance, we plan on looking into LEGO Minifigures, consumer ratings/reviews, the designers of the LEGO sets, and associations with popular entertainment. Moreover, the in-depth analysis of the LEGO datasets will equip us with knowledge to create a predictive model to determine the popularity of hypothetical LEGO sets which has not been accomplished by prior studies. We hope that the predictive model can be used as a tool for creators to test whether their sets could become a viable product. \n",

    "BrickLink Color Guide provides comprehensive information regarding colors in various categories of LEGO bricks. The online BrickLink community is a population of over 1 million registered users in 70 countries. Through their collective input, we have access to the number of parts of a certain color and its prevalence across sets. Additionally, we have access to the numerical demand and supply of a specific color as well as the length of its existence. All these variables are necessary for conducting our analysis to find an answer to our research question. We will transform the raw data by dropping columns storing irrelevant information and removing odd colors to achieve a tidy DataFrame, then combine with color information from Rebrickable. \n",

We extracted data pertaining to sets, themes, parts, colors, and Minifigures from an online, worldwide community with 940,114 registered users. It is important to note that since we pulled our dataset the third week of February 2024 that there has been a slight change in number of observations for each category. Raw data from Rebrickable will be organized by removing irrelevant columns and merging related datasets together to form a useful DataFrame.\n",

    "Our project necessitates careful consideration of ethical and privacy concerns throughout the data science lifecycle, from question formulation to data collection, analysis, and dissemination of results. One significant concern is the potential for sampling bias, where data may overrepresent LEGO enthusiasts and underrepresent casual consumers. Additionally, our data is likely to exhibit age bias, as the primary audience for LEGO sets (children) may not directly contribute data, skewing our dataset towards adult perspectives. Time bias is another factor, with older sets possibly having more accumulated data than newer ones.\n",

    "We must also navigate privacy and ethical issues related to using third-party data, particularly regarding user-generated content on platforms like Brickset, BrickEconomy, and others. These concerns include ensuring compliance with data privacy laws and the ethical treatment of information, especially when it pertains to minors. Our approach includes anonymizing any personal data and relying on aggregated or anonymized datasets provided by third-party sites, assuming they adhere to ethical standards and privacy laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate biases and ethical risks, we plan to incorporate a diverse range of data sources, aiming for a dataset that as accurately as possible reflects the global LEGO set market. We will also transparently communicate the limitations and potential biases of our analysis to users, highlighting that our findings may not fully represent the broader consumer base. Ensuring data privacy, especially for children, will be paramount, requiring strict adherence to legal and ethical guidelines for data handling and analysis."
